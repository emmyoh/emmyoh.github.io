## Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm Emil, a software developer based in the US.
Presently, I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at Miami University, in Oxford, OH, US.\
My professional experience so far includes:
- <p>Writing code to create unified views of data, as a data integration intern.</p>
- <p>Working to automate manual data management processes in an enterprise environment.</p>
On my own time, I work on open-source projects that I'm passionate about.\
These projects primarily have to do with systems programming and Web development, and tend to be written in Rust.\
See my [rÃ©sumÃ©/CV](https://dirout.github.io/resume), and check out my [portfolio](https://dirout.github.io).
